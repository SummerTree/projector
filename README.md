## Projector

Planning Center Projector was created and maintained by Planning Center for over 5 years, but unfortunately we have discontinued its development. This blog post explains our reasons. https://planning.center/2018/the-end-of-projector/

We have decided to open source Projector in the hopes that someone else will continue its development. Projector was built using Planning Centerâ€™s version 1 API which will be deprecated in early 2019, so to ensure Planning Center compatibility, it would need to be updated with version 2 of our API. For this reason, we have not open sourced the data or API layers. The User Interface and interactions are all there and could provide a substantial effort to anyone wanting to hook the data back up using our new API.
